# Guitar-Hero

A program to simulate guitar sounds by allowing the user to "pluck keys" by pressing certain keys on the keyboard. Implemented using a Queue and Array to represent a ring buffer data structure. Written using Java.

Make sure to have all of the java files download in the same directory for the program to work! Run the GuitarHero.java file to play sounds by pressing keys on the keyboard.
